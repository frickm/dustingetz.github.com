Sometimes we commit a less-than-well-understood piece of code. We're too much in a hurry to succintly summarize 'why' or 'how', but relevant discussion occurred in email or IM. Use your code review tool's snippets functionality (or github gist) to link the discussion from a comment. Takes two seconds, and will save the next person who wonders "why" a bunch of time.&nbsp;</p>
