<span style="font-style:italic;">There was absolutely _zero_ analysis done. You do not actually understand WHY the numbers matter. You just look at two random numbers, and one works, the other does not.... If you cannot see and understand the difference between an actual analytical solution where you _understand_ what the code is doing and why, and "random numbers that happen to work on one machine", I don't know what to tell you.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
...understand exactly _what_ goes wrong, and fix it analytically (ie by _understanding_ the problem, and being able to solve it exactly, and in a way you can argue about without having to resort to "magic happens"). ... I'd love to know exactly why one random number works, and why another one doesn't. But as long as we do _not_ know the "Why" of it, we will have to revert. </span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
