<span style="font-style:italic;">The Peter Principle states that "in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence", meaning that employees tend to be promoted until they reach a position at which they cannot work competently.

every promotion i ever got was by working with leadership to understand my growh areas, growing them, and actively demonstrating that in my day-to-day job im performing at a higher level of responsibility than my salary.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''><span style="font-family:sans-serif;">

in my experience, you don't get promotions before you're ready. [2]</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''><span style="font-family:sans-serif;">

[1] a collaray to this from bigco "individual contributor" ranks -- here, you get promoted every few years with age and experience, and its hard to stray very far ahead or behind the set pomotion schedule -- imo, this is the market equilibrium for the type of employees the bigco wants. ambitious promotion-seekers may be better served in a place that has room for uncapped growth.</span>&nbsp;</p>
