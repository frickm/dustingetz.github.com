##notes from wingspan 2012 kickoff

- client said: "most successful large project (> $30M) in 10 years"
- fewest number of issues ever gone to production wtih (60)
- never happens to client, not even hello world
- JY: largest ever, esp w/ small team
- Troy: fixed bid (nobody ever does this!)

##sales cycle
- wtih MSFT as a partner: 2-3 months
- b2b enterprise: 12, 18, even 24 months - for a $250k sale, careful budget review in IT. capital investment, internal approval change
- "implementation project" take months due to validation
- 
- stability
- "off a cliff"
- validation
- Total life value - services -> product maintenance revenue
- services bill by hour
- product - bill by value
- sales cycle analogy is like intellij at wingspan
- no single decision maker, no source of funds, the org/coropration collaborates. slow
- saas - shortens sales cycle (due to lower pricing, pay-what-you-use) - not a capial expenditure!
- quality of software vs number of people
- stability?

- stability - traditionally, companioes want ... of ... after buying
- saas = high lifetime value of customer
- "hit with a big bill"
- cost of app + dependencies is an investment
- vs service: just value. no discrete events to cause someone to rethink.
- saas scales the buisness, don't need 1 or 2 full time employees
- saas value: only sell to the business, not to the IT department
- ? bill - what's a "me too" industry? bandwagon
- "CEO relationships" > oracle > pfizer
- oracle clinical "must buy cloud"
- IBM etc, the businesses are ready now
- "we have to get there first"

##pfizer is like nordstrom
- gets people into the mall
- politics: pary on Larry Ellison's jet goes a long way
- Pfizer even considered paying the fine, fighting the EU in courts and not building the TMF. kills TMF market, dead.
- DOn't need an engineer to talk during sales
- DOn't have to support fucked up infrastructure
- get up to market but low license fee cost
- key:L drive out license cost, because revenue higher at same price point
- compare gmail and outlook. regulations, validation, compliance.

##rob
- cloud virtualization? (D: who cares?)
- brings costs down. pay-per-study
- rapid deployment (not like AWS, just remove biz friction)
- get slides from rob
- warner Vogels (Amazon CTO)
- seperate biz value from IT impl details
- govt mandate - cloud first

- TMF per study - 12% of costs
- MM dollars
- $500M = 2% of revenue in country
- can't run studies if not compliant
- legal documents
- growing pains - 50% of TMF docs missing
- france 45k women replace breast implants?
- nimble release cycle > quality (testing & coverage)
- viva systems (Meghan)
- choice between technical and enterprise CTO
