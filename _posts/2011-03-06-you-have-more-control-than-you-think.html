you have more control than you think<br></span><span style="">
<br>
I received notification that someone downvoted me on Stack Overflow today. I re-read my comment. My first thought: "Whoever down-voted me, you're wrong, and you're not smart enough to understand my comment."<br>
<br>
My second thought: "How could I have better communicated my point? This is a technical and highly intelligent audience, my writing must be unclear."<br>
<br>
Either my audience needs to get smarter, or I need to write more clearly. I have control over one of these.</span>
