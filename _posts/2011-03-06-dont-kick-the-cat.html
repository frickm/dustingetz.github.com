Don't kick the cat!<br></span><span style="">
<br>
One Christmas, at Mom's house, I walked by the Christmas tree, and--MEOOWRAAWR--her monster of a cat jumps out from under the tree and claws my foot! My reflex, of course, is to kick the thing. ... Timeout!<br>
<br>
If I kick the cat, the cat will feel defensive in the future, and my mother will throw me out. So I swallowed my reflex, put neosporin and slippers on, then nicely petted the darn cat.<br>
<br>
My personal relationships sure got a lot better after realizing this.</span>
