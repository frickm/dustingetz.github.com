<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">"You may be content with the abstraction that management is simply incompetent. This is certainly a common sentiment. But how incompetent can the pointy-haired boss really be if he employs dozens of people? Shouldn’t a little startup using XP be able to wipe the floor with bad companies in an hour? If all it takes is better engineering practice, shouldn’t the better engineers always win?" [1]</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">good article, this guy does affirm "management incompetent" opinion but does it well. but, i don't agree -- i think management is doing exactly what is expected of it. super-large software and systems integration contracts (think defense and aerospace) are risky, and no company is willing to accept the risk of a fixed-cost bid. the economics are such that almost all risk falls on the customer, and as such, bigco leadership can get away just fine, eeking out their 7% profit per hour billed, without superstar management and superstar technical teams.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">competition is helping this situation. For example, in 2011 Lockheed Martin has a corporate initiative to seek out and retain superstar talent, I heard they're only recruiting engineering college-hires at Stanford, MIT, Caltech. This is interesting because due to contract/project economics (big project = big hiring rampup, political balance changes every 4 years so funding shifts and projects get cut, internal job boards flooded, good people have to accept shitty assignments which really hurts retention).</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">anyway, management is doing exactly its job. bigco isn't willing to pay for superstar middle management levels -- they are executing an established business model quite effectively without superstars, and it makes sense to continue to do that while its economically feasible.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
