hey guys, i actually think he might have positive expectation:
he negotiated a .25% houe edge (roughly half of normal perfect play) and if he loses 500k he gets 20% back, each session independent.
check this analysis. he is +EV by martingaling his wins - 7/8 times he loses 400k with a 20% discount (400k x 7 x .80 = 2 240 000), 1/8 times he wins 400k x 8 with no reverse-discount = 3 200 000, so that's a mil in EV. if he pushes his martingale as far as he can his expectation grows superlinearly, which is why he martingales his wins until they cut him off.
is this math right? if he was -EV, the house would let him keep playing, hence telling him he can continue to play under normal rules. note he refused.
update: an easy way to see this (gross oversimplification) is if he plays only one hand/session he stands to win 100% of the money 49% of the time and loses 80% of the money 51% of the time.
