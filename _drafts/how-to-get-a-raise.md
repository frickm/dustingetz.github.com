this isn't going to be very popular, for obvious reasons.
> The most devoted, upstanding employees are the least paid, and the most conniving, disinterested ones are paid the most.
disagree. the best employees are the ones are constantly being recruited, they know their value, they have the quitting credibility to leave and go get a job anywhere else if their value isn't met.
anyway, if the employee wants to stay, it shouldn't get to the point of a counter offer. they ask for the raise, they have implied quitting credibility that is obvious and doesn't need to be used as a threat, they get the raise. if you have to actually threaten to quit, somebody is doing something wrong.
> If an employee tells you they have a job offer, tell them that if they take it then youâ€™ll wish them well, and stick to it.
clearly Mr Cohen isn't working with superstar engineers, the type that are a massive blow to the company if they leave. you do what you need to do to keep them at any cost, not whine on a blog.

if an employee has to threaten to leave to get a raise, someone is doing something wrong. probably the employee.

you don't have to threaten to leave to get a raise; you talk with your manager and tell him what you think you're worth and why its important to you that you make that, and you have a conversation about it. maybe you haven't demonstrated that you're worth it (go get a blog, speak at a user group, go earn your credibility). maybe the organization doesn't value talent at low levels [1], in which case you'll never get top compensation.

i think that's bullshit. "I make X, I feel I am worth Y". Credibly demonstrate that you are worth Y[1]. This got me the raise I wanted within my current employer, and willingness to decline an offer less than Y will get me the salary I want the next time I move companies.
[1] here's a hint: don't say "i can do XYZ, trust me" -- signal to them you can do XYZ by blogging, speaking at meetups, portfolio of projects, etc.
