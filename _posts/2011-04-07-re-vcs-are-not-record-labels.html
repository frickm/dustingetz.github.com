<span style="font-style:italic;">For one, the VC world is less predatory. There is a much higher standard of ethics ... than there is in the music business. No VC would ever consider that if your current venture becomes a success that they automatically have a right to any follow up success... no VC would want to be known in the same way that record companies are known for inserting themselves in to the cash flow part of the companies they fund, to lie and cheat about royalties due and to lobby the government for favorable legislation which effectively means a loss to the rest of society.... nor would they claim to hold the copyright on the products of the companies that they invest in... royalty fraud, price gauging and paying for special legislation may be the way for you but it does not give me any warm fuzzy feelings.

Seems to me there's a fundamental economic difference between the two industries: <span style="font-weight:bold;">record labels control distribution</span>. They have <span style="font-style:italic;">much</span> more leverage in their industry than VCs, so it is economically natural for the market to favor them. Industries don't have morals and will gravitate towards "shady" practices if the market rewards them.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'>
<span style="font-style:italic;">in the record industry, record labels control radio / media distribution and are much more powerful than the actual artists, and in the clothing industry, small designers are beholden to retail outlets and have to take terrible terms to get distribution. The takeaway? <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Being the distribution platform is a lot better than being a producer. </span>[2]</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:44px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
