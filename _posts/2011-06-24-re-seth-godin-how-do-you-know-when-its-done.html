1) novice teams that can't ship. The old school netscape team[2] that Joel wrote about[3]. they need to read this post.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
2) sophomoric teams that ship. Enterprise contracts and consulting firms. Meet the requirements, get paid. Engineers know how to solve hard problems, but the implementation is poorly understood. product works, users are pretty happy. Short term incentive to get paid overrules long term incentive to write great code, which causes compounding "technical debt". defect rate is high, development slows over time, 80% of engineering time was spent on fixing defects (cite Mythical Man Month), not easy to add features&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
3) classical teams that ship with clean implementation. Product teams. Databases, frameworks, operating systems. Engineers recognize that there are many implementations to solve a problem, and can accurately choose the implementation with lowest overall complexity. Low defect rate, maintenance is a pleasure. Long-term strategy to spend time reducing implementation complexity at the cost of costlier engineering now.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
I betcha a classical team can ship faster than the sophomoric team.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

</a>[2] not a criticism of the netscape team, software wasn't understood as well as it is now, and they were exploring uncharted waters&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
