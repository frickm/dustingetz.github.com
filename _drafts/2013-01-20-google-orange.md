If we want to understand why leadership does some apparently stupid thing, we should first assume that their decision is correct, then ask ourselves what situation must occur for us to make the same decision.

I used to arrogantly claim that microsoft's early technical decisions are crap, that AbstractFactoryFactoryProvider was written by an incompetent team, that twitter's old scalability issues were inexcusable. But assuming that these decisions were made by smart, competent people yields surprising insight and learning opportunities.
