title: Strange Loop 2012 talk - Monads for normal people in python (slides)
---

# {{ page.title }}

I gave this talk at Strange Loop 2012. The slides are great learning material for monads IMHO, presented in a way that doesn't exist anywhere else on the internet, that I could find (otherwise I wouldn't have had to do this talk!) Almost entirely presented in python, no fancy words, the focus is on how to use them and what they are good for, not the implementation details. Slides build up to a monadic list interpreter.
