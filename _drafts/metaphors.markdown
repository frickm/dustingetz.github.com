# metaphors aren't helpful

for me, when i find myself using metaphors, it means my understanding is insufficient to articulate a simple explanation. Metaphors aren't more valuable; they're a fallback for 

  metaphors are easier, but they can be unhelpful ("stealing music") or confusing (maybe some of your audience doesn't understand sports). i'd say if you can't explain it, you shouldn't be talking about it, but this isn't the case either - there a lot of valuable things that experts do intuitively, and their credibility is sufficient that we can say "ok i don't understand what he's trying to say but i should invest effort in understanding him so i can be like him". but if you don't have the credibility, nobody cares about your opinion, until its refactored enough that it's obviously correct.

my oh my the parallels to software. inheritance: "its like this other noun, but tweaked" -> chain of tweaks. composition: "this is what it is."
