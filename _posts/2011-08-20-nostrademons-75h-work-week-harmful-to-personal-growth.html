nostrademons: 75h work week harmful to personal growth</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

Nostrademons on HackerNews is Jonathan Tang[1]. I've re-blogged him before on <a href="http://www.dustingetz.com/2011/05/05/how-to-become-an-expert-swegr.html">how to become an expert software engineer</a>, my favorite HN comment ever. Inspirational. Get a blog, man.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

<span style="font-style:italic;">If I forked my life into a version of me that worked 50 hour work weeks and one that worked 75 hour work weeks, the 50-hour me would win, hands down. <span style="font-style:italic;background-color:rgb(255, 229, 0);">The 75 hour work week me would outright miss most of the key strategic decisions that got me where I am</span>. When I look at everything I've done that in hindsight has been a huge career boost - getting involved in the Harry Potter fandom, making friends on the C2 Wiki that got me a job in financial software, learning Lisp &amp; functional programming, founding a startup, and getting a job at Google - they all happened in the downtime between work. Had I simply worked 75 hour work weeks since 2001, I would be a physics grad student right now, hating it, and making a pittance. I'd probably be a damned good physics grad student, but that doesn't help me very much.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'><span style="font-style:italic;">
Now, <span style="font-style:italic;background-color:rgb(255, 229, 0);">I also put in quite a few hours into developing skills and building a track record, and I don't think those opportunities would've opened up if I hadn't. But I wouldn't have thought to look for the opportunities if I did nothing but concentrate on work.</span> You're a big fan of necessary but not sufficient conditions, right? The work is necessary, but so is the downtime.</span>&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'>
