Dale Carnegie 101: talk in other people's interest.<br>
<br>
Want to get that girl to like you? she doesn't care about your rough day, but she cares about her dog. You want her feeling good around you--not bored--so talk about her dog. Want to nail that business deal? stop telling them what you want, but figure out what they want and project the deal in terms of how you can help them.<br>
<br>
Every time you say "I", stop and re-evaluate if talking about yourself is helping you achieve your goals.</span>
