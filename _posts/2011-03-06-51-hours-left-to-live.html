51 hours left to live<br></span><span style="">
<br>
An anonymous man scheduled for euthenasia on Tuesday spent an hour <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy6yz/51_hours_left_to_live/">talking about it on the internet </a>on Saturday morning. I pulled out the interesting bits and formatted it to share. Questions are edited but I left his answers verbatim.<br>
--<br>
<br>
On Tuesday I'll finally end my battle with cancer thanks to Oregon's Death with dignity act. As part of my preparations I've ended my pain medication and am trying to regain what little dignity and clarity I can.<br>
Who I was doesn't matter. I'm in pain, I'm tired and I'm finally being granted a small shred of respect. Feel free to AMA [ed: ask me anything] if you're so inclined.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Wow. I......peace be with you. You may want to document your thoughts, or at least maintain this thread with updates.<br></span><span style="">
A: Honestly the pain is a bit of an issue, and I've been told to expect that. I promise to do my best to answer for as long as I can though<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: If you don't mind me asking. What type of cancer? And how long have you had it?<br></span><span style="">
A: Lymphoma and it spread<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: How old are you? What're the next days going to be like?<br></span><span style="">
A: 39. Next few days? I hope to spend the next 24 hours with family, and my new iPad. It's allowing me this forum, and to see so many pictures. Monday I hope to write as many letters as I can. Sorry, boring I know<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Fondest memories?<br></span><span style="">
A: Seeing my nephew beat cancer. He had it as a child and the doctors at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia cured it. 9 years and it never came back. A close second, the summer my dad and I saw a baseball game in every AL city.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Other than answering our questions, what are you going to spend your last hours doing?<br></span><span style="">
A: I'm going to live. This [ed: reddit.com] is as close to travel and meeting new people as I can get now. I'm sorry if that sounds dumb but this is my world tour<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: what message or lesson would you like to give to us and the rest of the world<br></span><span style="">
A: That nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, color, sex, religion, etc.... Theyre all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: There's an AMA going on started by someone who plans to commit suicide in the next few days. What, if anything would you say to him to try and get him to rethink things?<br>
</span><span style="">A: I would tell him that it's not living that's failed him, it's life. We can always change our life as long as were living. He's addressing the wrong issue<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: What are you having for your last meal?<br></span><span style="">
A: Jello. I don't want to mess myself ever again. It's one of the dignities I've lost that I plan to reclaim<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: A lot of people oppose death with dignity, labeling them "doctor assisted suicide". Do you have any words that might convince people who oppose it why you chose this option?<br></span><span style="">
A: Yes, I do. Why do they oppose peoples right to not suffer? It takes numerous doctors to get here ensuring no one uses this option recklessly. My care is a huge burden to my loved ones, and it's not fair to position your suspicions over their realities.<br>
And yes, religion is at best a suspicion. None of us knows...<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: How long have you been fighting cancer?<br></span><span style="">
A: For 6 years. It's now spread to my brain and I just can't do more surgeries.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Did you create any sort of "bucket list". If so, how did it progress?<br></span><span style="">
A: One, have a child of my own and I failed. I really would like to have seen the Northern Lights too<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Are you scared of dieing? Are you scared of being dead?<br></span><span style="">
A: Terrified, but I won't ever tell my family that. I hope it doesn't hurt<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Gonna do anything worthwhile in your last two days? Something you've always wanted to do?<br></span><span style="">
A: I plan to make a YouTube video. That's all<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Why Tuesday and not, say, Friday?<br></span><span style="">
A: My sisters birthday is the 18th, and she won't spend it in a hospital or at a service.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: any regrets?<br></span><span style="">
A: Yes, one. I bought my high school sweetheart an engagement ring and never gave it to her. Life happened, meaning in was dumb. I went in the military after a dumb fight and.... Yeah just one<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: what's your proudest moment?<br></span><span style="">
A: Finishing my masters degree, from a hospital bed. First person in my family to get one!<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: What are you going to miss the most? What are you going to miss the least (other than the chemo and cancer)?<br></span><span style="">
A: Miss the most, life. Not this life the one I see out my window. The least, the shame of putting my loved ones throughnthis<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Do your family and friends respect your wishes or are they trying to convince you to hang on?<br></span><span style="">
A: They understand. They are leaving tomorrow night, at my request. Maybe it's vanity but their last memory will be time with me being happy and in control of my life. With the drugs that's not happened in months.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Do you believe in an afterlife? Either way did it effect you decision?<br></span><span style="">
A: No and no. Pain and fear drove this decision. I've lost my ability to walk, travel, love.... There's no future but pain, so why not?<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Knowing the hour and day must be difficult. What kinds of thoughts have been running through your head? Has it been weighing on you as much as I imagine it would be?<br></span><span style="">
A: Not too much yet. Monday I think will be hardest<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Can I ask you a quick question if you don't mind? I am very hesitant on improving my social skills with people. I am shy (and currently a college student who is a guy), but am trying to improve myself and meet more people and make more connections in the world. I feel like fear is what holds me back. I've always wanted to ask someone who is in there final end of life for wisdom on this. What would be your advice on taking chances and meeting new people? Or on Fear? Sorry if this sounds silly. I guess I just always wanted to ask someone like you this question. I hope you find peace wherever you are or in whatever happens next :).<br></span><span style="">
A: It doesn't. Thank you for this, as it let's me live beyond my walls. My question tonyounwould be this, what long term risk is there in saying hello? I can't find any. Worst case, is you get some possessive asshole that thinks your hitting on his sister and you get a black eye. Total pain and shame lasts maybe a month. Meeting the right girl though lasts forever. So you tell me, would youmtrade a month of shame for a life of happiness?<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Why the throwaway [ed: why post anonymously]?<br></span><span style="">
A: Just got an iPad today, and found reddit from my nephew. Not been lucid enough to actually use the Internet. So, it's not a throwaway it's an aloha account. Hello and goodbye<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: Do you feel that you will be leaving anything/anyone behind?<br></span><span style="">
A: Everyone. You all could have improved my life through your adventures. When someone gets sick those that love them shut offnthe outside world to focus on them. All we want is a glimpse of normal<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: I'm pretty young, relatively speaking. I find myself thinking about death pretty regularly, even though I still have much time left, I hope. I just have one question: Is is scary? The uncertainty of what happens after, seeing time tick away a second at a time, not being able to know how history runs it's course in the days afterward? I realize that these are all pretty dreadful things to think about, but what's running through your head? Any thoughts of peace? <br></span><span style="">
A: I'm not watching the clock yet. My fears are all over the place, but really focus on two things. Please don't let it hurt, and whatever happens let my family move on to happier times. I don't want more pain for myself or anyone else<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: If you could have your health back for one day before you say goodbye, what would you do with your time?<br></span><span style="">
A: Go to Key West Florida. I was there once and saw the sun rise and set in the same day. Was really peaceful and sharing it with her would be more then I deserve<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Q: How will this happen? Will you be at home? Have you already arranged your funeral? What do you think your last thought will be? As you slip away, what's the one thought that you're going to hold onto? What are your religious beliefs? After you die, what do you think will happen? You've made a rational choice to end your life while you still had the capacity to do that, and I salute you for that.<br>
</span><span style="">A: I'm given medication by the doctor to self administer. I already have the iv so it should be easy. I don't have a home, it was consumed in medical bills. I have made final arrangements. Last thought is too personal sorry. No religious beliefs to mention<br>
