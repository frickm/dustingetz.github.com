the importance of shared ownership in software teams</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

its not shit code that pisses me off. we write code fast, we dont necessarily fully understand the problem because we're exploring, we get it in, we move on, we come back later when we know the requirements better, we improve. what pisses me off is when this grows to the point that nobody "owns" anything, everyone gets in-and-out as fast as possible with their bandaids because they're afraid to refactor, they don't take ownership -- its 'someone elses code', 'they' should maintain it.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

you go into a place, own it. make it better. understand the issues the original author encountered, and take ownership while you maintain it. when you leave, its no longer the prior author's code -- its yours. and if there's shit code or confused code in there when you're done, its your fault. invest time in getting it better than the prior person, because you have more information than them.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

this attitude of shared ownership is important, because otherwise, the bandaids pile up to the point that there is no majority owner -- the lines are evenly spread across the whole team and nobody understands the subsystem as a whole. it's self-evident that if nobody understands the system, you no longer have control over your schedule, roadmap, or quality.&nbsp;</p>
