Lessons in marketing from a 15-year-old<br></span><span style="">
<br>
so this guy <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/antimatter15">@antimatter15 </a>has a bunch of small open source apps, including <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll">drag2up,</a> a nifty chrome extension for uploading files. Antimatter15 writes:<br>

</span><span style="font-style:italic;">drag2up was written by @antimatter15. The source code is available on github. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">A totally irrelevant fact is that at time of writing I'm 15 years old, but that tends to make people treat this as more of an accomplishment than it really is and thus more inclined to share it.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> So now that you are aware of this, you should follow me on twitter and share this extension with everyone you know.[1]<br></span><span style="">

I've read most of his stuff and if I had to guess his age I'd say he's a talented twenty-something. The above statement demonstrates acute social awareness and understanding of how to utilize it, which I find unlikely for a 15 year old guy with brilliant technical skills. OTOH, I tend to bias my perception to think people are more like me than they actually are. Whatever.<br>
