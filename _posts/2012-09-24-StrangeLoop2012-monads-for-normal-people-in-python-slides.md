title: Talk: Strange Loop 2012: Monads for normal people in python (slides)
---

# {{ page.title }}

I gave this talk at Strange Loop 2012. The slides are great learning material for monads IMHO. Almost entirely done in python, no fancy words, the focus is on how to use them and what they are good for, not the implementation details.
