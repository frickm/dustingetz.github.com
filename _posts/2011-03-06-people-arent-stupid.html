people aren't stupid<br></span><span style="">
<br>
I'm guilty of calling people stupid in hyperbole, when i really mean a more complex thought like "he drew a weak conclusion because he oversimplified a complex issue, and doesn't realize it." Many people I've called stupid have a college degree which signals that they're probably not stupid.<br>

Amit Patel on <a href="http://amitp.blogspot.com/2007/04/lisp-vs-python-syntax.html">lisp-vs-python-syntax:</a><br>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"When I read debates online, I have a bias towards the people who view these things as tradeoffs and a bias against the people who say there's only one right answer and everyone else is stupid or clueless. This has sadly pushed me away from Lisp, the Mac, and other systems that I think are really good but have fanatical communities. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">When you're in a debate, consider that the other person might not be stupid</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, and there might be good reasons for his or her choices. You'll not only learn something about their position, but you'll be more likely get people to listen to you and adopt your point of view."<br>

I prefer to word this more strongly: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">never assume that the antagonist is stupid</span><span style="">. Its more helpful to idenfify the miscommunication leading them to a weak conclusion, and <a href="http://www.dustingetz.com/2011/03/06/you-have-more-control-than-you-think.html">try to communicate more effectively.</a> Calling someone stupid has no value other than I'm-right-you're-wrong ego-masturbation.</span>
