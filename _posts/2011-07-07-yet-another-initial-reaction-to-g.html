biggest difference to facebook -- all public content, can be seen without logging in. Open me up in an incognito tab, you can see my posts. Facebook doesn't let you view anonymously.[1] This means that:&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

im going to host my blog in it. no more <a href="http://dustingetz.com">dustingetz.com</a>. free hosting, google scales when i hit frontpage HN. Blog exists as a way to build professional credibility,  so linking it intricately with my online identity makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

really looking forward for this to release in google apps. learning curves (knowledge sharing) is something every team faces, and usually the workflow for this is a) staff meetings and b) mass emails. here are some non-action emails sent to my dev team mailing list this week (maybe 10 people):&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
new test environment details&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
dev environment settings changed&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
one dude out sick, another due in late, etc&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
nightly build/test results&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
dev environment settings changed again&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
interesting javascript blog post&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
core ui feature added w/ howto&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
interesting extjs code review&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
like 4 threads in the last two weeks where i push functional patterns and scala-pr0n to a couple interested teammates&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
none of these are actions, so email isn't the proper workflow because it interrupts people for unimportant things. buzz sorta helped solve this and G+ if integrated well certainly solves it with passive content streams.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

[1] i'm facebook could easily allow anonymous views, but to date they have no interest in being a tool for professionals -- their take on social is purely ... social? haha.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
[2] Lockheed Martin is attacking enterprise knowledge sharing with <a href="http://www.eurekastreams.org/">Eureka Streams</a>, but i speculate that barriers to adoption of knowledge sharing tech are related to organizational culture, not technical stuff.&nbsp;</p>
