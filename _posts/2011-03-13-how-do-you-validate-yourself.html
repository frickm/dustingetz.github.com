how do you validate yourself?<br></span><span style="">
<br>
Vanity Fair published an interesting perspective on <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/dubai-201104?currentPage=all">Dubai's culture of extravagance:</a><br>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Among the other 80-plus percent are the white mercenary workers who come here for tax-free salaries to do managerial and entrepreneurial jobs, parasites and sycophants for cash. For them money is a driving principle and validation. They came to be young, single, greedy, and insincere.... So they live lives that revolve around drink and porn sex and pool parties and barbecues with a lot of hysterical laughing and theme nights, karaoke, and slobbery, regretful coupling.<br></span><span style="">
<br>
I spent ages 21-24 validating some darker aspects of myself against this lifestyle[1].<br>
<br>
I think everyone validates themselves. We validate ourselves against the things we think are important, which are often the standards of people we respect. Family, religion, peers, employer. Confidence and content with our life comes from meeting our standards; misery comes from failing to meet them[2].<br>
<br>
It's all relative! The kids hooking up in Dubai are behaving in ways valued by their peers. Despite the journalist's tone, there's nothing wrong with that! Sometimes we have conflicting standards, maybe inner turmoil over how we gravitate to the callous standards of our acquaintenances, failing to meet our inner moral standards. <br>
<br>
In the end, its our choice. Me, recently I've had a burning drive to "play with the big boys" on Hacker News, and as such derive confidence knowing that I'm well on my way to Hacker News-level awesomeness[3]. This has manifested itself lately with spending 80 hours a week between my day job and my side projects. How about my mother? She's tremendously proud of starting from scratch a Montessori school. My friend Lindsay? She just started a family, and she </span><span style="font-style:italic;">lives</span><span style=""> for raising her 7-month-old daughter. And of course, the kids in Dubai, we already know what they value.<br>
<br>
When I'm about to die, I want to be able to look back and be happy with my choices at each stage of my life. And really, this matters so much more than any technical accomplishment. We just have to make sure we're always optimizing the right thing.<br>

</span><span style="font-size:0.8333333333333334em;">[1] Fortunately, I seem to have outgrown, or at least understood and controlled, my attraction to glamour.<br>
[2] I'm sure there are other intelligent world-views which explain this, psychology is complicated.<br>
