From HN discussion on 'Fire the Workaholics' [1]&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'>
When I was in my early twenties.... My motto was the typical, "word hard, play hard." I worked 12+ hour days fairly regularly. The work was interesting, the people were cool, and I was learning a lot. I remember leaving work one morning as people were coming in; their day was starting as my day was ending.... Now that I'm in my thirties, I don't work as many hours, though my work output hasn't decreased. Instead, I like to think that I work smarter now, not harder. I still really enjoy my work - and oftentimes don't even feel like I'm "working." But if I spend too much time on something, instead of slogging through it, I'll stop and look for a more efficient solution. I've learned that time is too valuable for brute force.&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'>

On the surface, it may not seem like I'm working as much. I work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day now, but in aggregate, I get much more done. And none of those hours really feels like work. I attribute this to having passion for what I do, and learning how to work smart.&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left:22px'>

Mike, you sound a lot like me now. I'm a typical "work hard play hard" twenty-something, and if it was possible for me to be working smarter, I don't see it. I probably spend my first 40 hours solving/understanding the problem, and the next 30 hours refactoring the code to look like my mental model of the solution. I'd love to slow down but it's just doesn't seem possible to ship a high quality product given our schedule. Some of the senior folks work saner hours, but it's not at all obvious if their output is greater and higher quality than mine, or even equal quality. (This isn't a slight--i'm getting twice as much zone time as them!) If they're 'working smarter' than me, I can't see how, other than having already paid the learning curve for a large set of problems.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

Mike commented back[2], basically stating that when he was younger he built too much from scratch, under-valued design patterns, under-valued unit testing and other ways to ensure correctness, and didn't have mastery of his tools[3]. Mike, thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

All you thirty-something technical wizards: In what ways do you work smarter now, that you yourself as a the whiz-bang super-confident twenty-something? What are some lessons you would send back in time?&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

I'll start the discussion with a link to an amazing comment by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=185153">Nostrademons: how to become an expert software engineer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

[3] As a manager, Mike also realized that there are always people smarter than he, and if you can hire them and remove all their roadblocks, his value is greater than his value as an individual contributor. I agree, but don't want to focus on this approach right now.&nbsp;</p>
