forget functional programing, lets do narrative programming</span>&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

You know, I've learned something today!&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
When some people talk about functional programming, they talk about monads and iterating with recursion and lambda calculus.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
Other people talking about functional programming mean using data-oriented abstractions, where functions operate on data in well-defined ways, to avoid state and interlocked dependencies[3]. I've been calling the latter a "functional style", but clearly there is ambiguity and people get turned off and say things like "we're using an OO language why would i want FP"&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

This image by Avdi Grimm is the most articulate description i've ever seen comparing good code to bad, and it's Ruby, :&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

</a>in Avdi Grimm's talk "Confident Code"[2] he calls this style "narrative structure", compared to "haphazard structure"[4]. I like that; "functional" envokes all sorts of emotion about being hard to understand and unnecessary. "Narrative" or "confident" or "data-oriented" are more articulate, and don't evoke flame wars.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

Avdi's example (code screenshot) is the most articulate example of this I've yet seen.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>

And it's in ruby. Nothing hard here, but it meets a functional style per John D Cook's definition[1]: "OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts." "functional in the small and OO in the large" seems a good path. The Scala community seems to get this, and seems to me Scala is mainstreaming much quicker than any of the pure functional languages.&nbsp;</p><p style=''>
