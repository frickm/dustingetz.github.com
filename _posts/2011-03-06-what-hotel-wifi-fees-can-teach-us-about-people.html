What hotel wifi fees can teach us about people<br></span><span style="">
<br>
Via Reddit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e2uui/why_is_wifi_free_at_mcdonalds_but_when_i_stay_at/">Why is wifi free at McDonald's but when I stay at a $300/night hotel I have to pay extra for it?<br>
</a></span><span style="font-style:italic;">A typical 300/night hotel might have 300 to 700 rooms that require wireless coverage. This means they'll require anywhere from 30 to 120 wireless Access Points. To support these Access Points, they'll also require up to 20 or more switches in some cases. Along with that, there must be cabling to support the hardware which frequently needs to be run through a building that was never designed to allow cabling of that type. That's saying the building hasn't even planned for hardwired connections. All in all, without the cost of hardware purchase these hotels are easily looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars just to put the system in.<br>
<br>
A McDonalds? Requires one single Access Point, no switches, and a regular 6Mb internet connection.<br>

When I'm frustrated with my boss, or colleague, or girlfriend, it helps to remember that usually there are factors unseen by me that motivate and probably justify a frustrating decision.</span>
