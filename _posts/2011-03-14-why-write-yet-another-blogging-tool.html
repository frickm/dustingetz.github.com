why write yet another blogging tool?<br></span><span style="">
<br>
Strunk &amp; White, on great writing[1]:<br>
</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.<br>
<br></span><span style="">
I'm not naturally a great communicator. Reaching a Strunk &amp; White level of clarity means I need to revise, over and over. For each piece I publish, I discarded five others, because they weren't good enough, and on any given day, I have far more drafts than published posts.<br>
<br>
Blogging tools like Typepad and Posterous don't keep me organized; they just don't mesh well with a revision-heavy workflow. You typically need to manage and revise your drafts outside the platform. This chaos means I feel like writing less (read: never). I need a tool that helps me manage the chaos.<br>
<br>
Google wave[2] solves </span><span style="font-style:italic;">exactly</span><span style=""> this problem. Thus arises my workflow:<br>
<br>
Edit and manage my drafts in google wave<br>
Publish directly from google wave<br>
<br>
Thats it! Here's a <a href="http://cdn.lts.cr/files/0d78b2c391b8a6b52b75/wave-blog-workflow.png">screenshot of my google wave workflow.</a><br>
<br>
I had to custom-write the platform to support this workflow. Credit's not all mine; I glued a bunch of open source code together. In-progress <a href="https://github.com/dustingetz/publisher">source on github,</a> technical details coming soon.<br>

[2] I realize Wave's shutdown could be announced at any moment. In the event of Wave's shutdown, I can write content in Google Docs or Gmail or any other rich text editor, so its not a risk to my blog, so much as it is a risk to my desire to write :</span><span style="font-size:0.8333333333333334em;">(</span>
